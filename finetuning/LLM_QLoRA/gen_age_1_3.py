     'assistant': 'story title: The Pout-Pout Fish\n\nDeep in the water where the fish hang out lives a glum gloomy swimmer with an ever-present pout. "I\'m a pout-pout fish with the pout-pout face. So I spread the dreary-wearies all over the place." Blurb, bluuub bluuuuuub.\n\nAlong comes a clam with a wide winning grin and a pearl of advice for her pal to take in. "Hey, Mr. Fish. With your crosstown frown, don\'t you think it\'s time to turn it upside down?" Says the fish to his friend, "Nice thought, Ms Clam. I hear what you\'re saying, but it\'s just the way I am. I am a pout-pout fish with the pout-pout face. So I spread the dreary-wearies all over the place." Blurb, bluuub bluuuuuub.\n\nAlong Comes a jellyfish. He floats through the ocean. His tentacles all trailing in a gentle locomotion. "Hey, Mr. Fish. With your daily scary scowl, I wish you wouldn\'t greet us with a grimace and a growl." Says the fish to his friend, "Mr. Jelly, I agree. I\'d like to be more friendly, but it isn\'t up to me. I\'m a pout-pout fish with a pout-pout face. So I spread the dreary-wearies all over the place." Blurb, bluuub bluuuuuub.\n\nAlong comes a squid. Quite a slender squiggly sight. She is squirmy. She is squelchy. She is slightly impolite. "Hey Mr. Fish. You kaleidoscope of mope. How about a smile? A little Joy? A little hope?" Says the fish to his friend, "Mrs. Squid, I would try. But I haven\'t any choice. Take a look and you\'ll see why. I\'m a pout-pout fish with a pout-pout face. So I spread the dreary-wearies all over the place." Blurb, bluuub bluuuuuub.\n\nAlong Comes an octopus with eight great arms covered on the underside with tiny sucker charms. "Hey, Mr. Fish. Let me tell it to you straight. Your hulky bulky sulking is an unattractive trait!"  Says the fish to his friend, "Mr. Eight, my chum, with a mouth like mine I am destined to be glum. I\'m a pout-pout fish with a pout-pout face. So I spread the dreary-wearies all over the place." Blurb, bluuub bluuuuuub.\n\nNow along comes a fish in a silent silver shimmer. The gang has never seen before this bright and brilliant swimmer. She approaches Mr. Fish, but instead of saying hey ... She plants a kiss upon his pout, and then she swims away. Mr. Fish is most astounded. Mr. Fish is just aghast. He is stone-faced like a statue. Then he blinks and speaks at last: "My friends", says Mr. Fish. "I should have known it all along. I thought that I was pouty. But it turns out I was wrong. I\'m a kiss-kiss fish with a kiss-kiss face for spreading cheery-cherries all over the place!" So I\'ll smooch, smooch, smooch, smooch, smoooooooch.'}

I love to lift you way up high, so you feel really tall! We\'ll climb the highest mountaintops. Hold tight and you won\'t fall. I love to share the magic of The shining skies above. And think of all the different ways that we can show our love. Like when we\'re touching noses. Playing Chase. Or seeing friends. Our love is always with us, and it never ever ends. So snuggle safely in my arms; our day is nearly done. I love you to the moon and stars, my precious little one.'}
